# :milky_way: Determination-of-the-mass-of-the-pleiades

Project in R language using astronomical. All theoretical information is available in the report folder in pdf or html format.

## :keyboard: About source code

The script seems to be trying to analyze data of mass star cluster by performing calculations and creating visualizations.

Here is a brief summary of what the script is doing:

1. Loading the data from the file pleiades.txt.
2. Defining functions compute_degrees() and generall_function() to calculate the right ascension, declination, and other values.
3. Calculating the right ascension and declination in hours and degrees, respectively.
4. Calculating the average distance and average proper motions in right ascension and declination directions.
5. Correcting proper motions for the average values and calculating the velocity in meters per second.
6. Calculating the size of the star cluster in meters and its mass using the velocity dispersion.
7. Sorting the data by the distance from the cluster center and splitting it into 19 parts.
8. Calculating the 90th percentile of each part of the data and storing it in a list.
